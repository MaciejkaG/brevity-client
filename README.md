# brevity-client
Electron-based client for an unfinished modern and minimalistic notes app.

Brevity is a modern and minimalistic open-source note app. I don't know if I ever finish it, but it's the repo for it.<br>
In case you want to see the early code, see the `nightly` branch.

# Note
Brevity is in an EXTREMELY early state, do not judge the design/functionality yet. Everything is a matter of change.
